# coffee-sales-analysis-in-excel

This project involves analyzing coffee sales data using various advanced Excel functions and tools, providing valuable insights into customer behaviors, sales trends, and more.

Key Functions and Tools Utilized:

1. **XLOOKUP**:
   - Employed to search for and retrieve customer names, email addresses, countries, coffee types, roast types, size, unit price, and sales data.
   - Specifically in the Email column, XLOOKUP was used in conjunction with IF statements to either return the email address if a match was found or retain an empty cell if no match was found.

2. **INDEX and MATCH**:
   - Utilized to accurately match and retrieve data for Coffee Type, Roast Type, and Size.

3. **IF Statements**:
   - Applied to convert coffee type and roast type abbreviations into their full names for better readability.

4. **Data Formatting**:
   - Date, Size, Unit Price, and Sales columns were formatted for consistency and clarity.

5. **Duplicate Check**:
   - The entire table was thoroughly checked for any duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

6. **Loyalty Cards**:
   - Created for customers who qualified based on specific criteria, enhancing customer retention strategies.

### Data Analysis:

The cleaned and processed data was converted into a Pivot Table to facilitate comprehensive analysis. Sample questions addressed include:

- **Total Sales (2019-2022)**: Analyzed total sales over the period from 2019 to 2022 to identify trends and patterns.
- **Sales by Country**: Evaluated sales distribution across different countries to understand market performance.
- **Top Five Customers**: Identified the top five customers based on sales volume, providing insights into customer loyalty and high-value clients.

### Visualization and Insights:

A visually compelling dashboard was created to present the analyzed data, including:

- **Sales Trends**: Line charts depicting total sales over time.
- **Sales by Countries**: Pie chart showing sales by country.
- **Top 5 customers**: Bar chart highlighting top customers.
